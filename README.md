# Python_shiny_app

Two versions of the Shinylive app embedded within Quarto documents are available:

1. [Older method which imports csv file via manual input](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/13_Shiny_app_python/ShinyAppPy_PC_Cov19_app_embed.html) - works best for small to medium-size files with longer code

2. [Using pyodide.http.open_url() method to import csv file](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/13_Shiny_app_python/ShinyAppPy_PC_Cov19_app_embed_pyodide_http.html) - likely not restricted by file size and cleaner code version
